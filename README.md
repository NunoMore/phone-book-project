# phone-book-project

This project was created using Visual Code IDE and MY Sql workbench.

The Front-End was with the usage of ReactJS and the Back-End with NodeJS. The database was with MySql.

To run the program, one has to run both the react and node projects (for example using Visual Code IDE with "npm start" and "npm run server" - respectively).

There is a MySql script which can be used to create the schema and the tables as well as to initialize the tables with testing entries.

The configurations for the database connection are in the ".env" file in the root of the "phone_book_node" folder.

The program is supposed to get the data from the database and execute a CRUD app. Meaning, the user can create, read, update and delete entries from the database.

The program is complete without the input validations
